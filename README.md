Comparison of Proj4JS and ArcGIS Server Geometry Service
========================================================

The purpose of this project is to compare the results of two different projection methods: the client-side [Proj4JS](http://trac.osgeo.org/proj4js/) library and an [ArcGIS Server Geometry Service](http://resources.arcgis.com/en/help/rest/apiref/).
